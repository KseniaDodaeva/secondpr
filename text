Winter broke into the city. The wind drove fallen leaves through the streets, drizzled with cold rain. Today in the morning everything is white and white. A snowy night under the snow that sparkled and flew in the rays of the bright morning sun. Faces of passers-by dressed in warm coats and down jackets. The children did not hide their enthusiasm and loudly rejoiced at the long-awaited snow. Near schools, real snow battles unfolded. Many schoolchildren, and even some teachers, were shelled by snowballs. Everyone on this day was in a joyful, high spirits. Winter takes over, magic.
